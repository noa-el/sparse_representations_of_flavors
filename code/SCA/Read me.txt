An improved sparse component analysis (SCA) is developped. The SCA method is just defined in a framework before, but there no existing complete algorithm. We explore a compelte and automatical algorithm, then use it to deal with modal identification issue.

The corresponding paper "Identification of modal parameters using an improved sparse blind source separation" has been submitted to MSSP.

Due to SCA based on instaneous mixing model, so it is only able to process sensor data without time-delay. So I advice you processing the data recorded in rigid structure instead of flexible structure.

I am so sorry that the function 'L1_norm_min' have a heavyly computational burden, which is always time-consuming. I will do my best to propose a new method for recovering sources instead of L1-norm minimization method.

If you have some suggestions or found bugs, you can send me email. I greatly acknowledge your any  advices, which will make this software better. And I will do my best to improve it. My email address is 'yugang2010@163.com'.
 
Thank you for reading it again.
